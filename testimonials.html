                    <div class="testimonialTxt"><p>Furry Friends Doggy Daycare has been a game-changer for me and my dog. Before finding this daycare, I struggled to find time to give my dog the exercise and socialization she needed. But now, I drop her off a few times a week, and she comes home happy, tired, and well-socialized. I couldn't be happier with the care and attention she receives at Furry Friends.</p></div>
